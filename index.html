  "Hello, my name is " + fullName.value + ", a legal citizen of Afghanistan. My family and I lived in " + locationAfghanistan.value + ", Afghanistan. " + 
  locationAfghanistan.value + " is a very nice area of Afghanistan. It is located xxx miles from Kabul, Afghanistan. I belong to the Afghan Hindu-Sikh Community in a majority Moslem country. " +
  "Our lives were normal before the Islamic Mujahidin came to power in Afghanistan in 1992. I had a family business and we were good in " + occupationAfghanistan.value + ". We were very successful in what we were doing and had become very " +
  "experienced in this field." + "\r\n\r\n" +
  "Everything changed after the Islamic Mujahidin came to power in 1992. They made life hell for the " +
  "Afghan Hindus and Sikhs and especially for the Hindus and Sikhs with businesses. They simply could not appreciate the know-how involved in " +
  "successfully running a business and were totally clueless. They started extorting money from us and we had to oblige " +
  "until we had little left. Then the Mujahidin started convincing me to convert to Islam which I flatly ignored. They kept putting psychological pressure on me. " +
  "For a Hindu or a Sikh conversion to Islam is tantamount to a death sentence. The Hindus and Sikhs hold a funeral for a person who converts to Islam, so there is nothing worse for a Hindu or a Sikh than to convert to Islam. " +
  "I was extremely scared. The Mujahidin flag had the Kalima inscription in it and if any of a Hindus or a Sikhs read it, he/she would be considered a Moslem. " +
  "I became scared of the flag. I did not want to look at the flag or touch it. If a Hindu or a Sikh touched anything that had verses from Quran (the Moslem Book) written on it " +
  "he/she would be charged with the crime of Blasphemy which would carry the punishment stoned to death. I had to be extremely careful. No lawyer or judges would take the case. "+
  "" +
  "" +
  "The Islamic Mujahidin mutilated the body an Afghan Hindu boy in our community named Nikchu Khanna. The news has traumatized me." +
  "" + "\r\n" +

  "My family and I made the most difficult decision of our lives and moved to India in " + yearMoved.value + ". Myself and my family went " +
  "through Pakistan and then India. It was heartbreaking and still hoped to return back to our country " +
  "Afghanistan. I hoped that the Mujahidin Government would be terminated. This did not happen and " +
  "instead the Mujahidin were toppled by another dreaded regime, the Taliban. Taliban were more brutal " +
  "than the Islamic Mujahidin. Again I did not lose hope and was waiting for an opportune time to " +
  "return back to my beloved Afghanistan. The Allied Forces toppled the dreaded Taliban in 2001 and the control of " +
  "the government fell to the remnants of the Islamic Mujahidin, the Northern Alliance. While in " + locationIndia.value + ", the " +
  "news was that the warlords in Afghanistan were usurping properties belonging to the Afghan Hindus " +
  "and Sikhs. Some Islamic Terrorists massacred the Hindus and Sikhs leadership July 1, 2018 and again on March 25, 2020, " +
  "the terrorists killed close to 50 Sikhs in one of the Sikh temples of Kabul. Again they attacked the Gurdwara on June 18, 2022 and killed many "+
  "worshipers. In the 1970's the Hindu and Sikh population of Afghanistan was roughly 350,000, today there are no more than 50 left. "+
  "I decided not to move back " +
  "to Afghanistan until things came under control. However the matter was getting worse by the day. It " +
  "was dashing the hope of my going back. In August of 2021, the Taliban came to Afghanistan by force " +
  "and totally dashed my hope of ever returning back to Afghanistan. The Hindus and Sikhs have been " +
  "summed up by Taliban and have been ordered not to dare out." + "\r\n\r\n" +
  "It is impossible to trust the Taliban, their words mean nothing. They follow Islam to the letter and there is simply no room for a Hindu or a Sikh to live "+
  "under their jurisdiction." +

  "In India I have total religious freedom and deal with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees " +
  "(UNHCR) frequently. The UNHCR is inundated with too many refugees. The UNHCR does not recommend a Hindu or Sikh for refugee visa, therefore I have no "+
   "choice, but to apply for Humanitarian Parole Visa However I find it very difficult to " +
  "fit in. When I speak Hindi, I have the Afghan accent which is recognizable, the weather is very hot " +
  "and I am used to the cold weather of Afghanistan. The food is very hot. It is very difficult to adjust. " +
  "After living in India for so long, I have realized that most of our successful community members had " +
  "migrated to North America and Europe. My family and I failed to develop the business contacts I had " +
  "in Afghanistan. I simply did not have the social net to help us live a normal life. The COVID-19 lock down in 2021 in New Delhi area " +
  " thought us a lesson that without a close community support, I can not survive. My close community members in the USA and Europe came to our " +
  "rescue and helped us survive." + "\r\n\r\n" +
  "I work as a " + occupationIndia.value +
  " for a business in " + locationIndia.value + ", India and am one of the top producers; my income is $" + income.value + " per month. If I had my " +
  "community support, I could have started my own business and generated results. I find it very difficult to " +
  "navigate the Indian bureaucracy and trust the Chartered Accounts (CA)’s without proper references. The CA’s in India setup new business and do the compliance reporting I " +
  "need to live in North America or Europe where I would have my community support and have the vetted " +
  "business resources to succeed. In the bottom of my heart I consider ourselves very good business and expert in the Industry. " +
  "" + "\r\n" +
  
  "I would be very grateful for a chance to move to the west and prove my capabilities and generate results. " +
  "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n" +
