  "Hello, my name is " + fullName.value + ". My family and I lived in " + locationAfghanistan.value + ", Afghanistan. " + 
  locationAfghanistan.value + " is a very nice area of Afghanistan. We belong to the Hindu Community in a majority Moslem country. " +
  "Our lives were normal and I was a " + occupationAfghanistan.value + ". I was very succesful in what I was doing and had become very " +
  "experienced in this field." + "\r\n\r\n" +
  "Everything changed after the Islamic Mujahidin came to power in 1992. They made life hell for the " +
  "Afghan Hindu " + occupationAfghanistan.value + "s. They simply could not appreciate the know-how involved in " +
  "working in this field. They started to follow me after I left the field and stopped me " +
  "with gun point and demanded money. If I did not give them money, they would threaten me with the " +
  "charge of blasphemy which would result in death by stoning. They stopped me three time at gun point " +
  "and literally took all my capital and whatever I had. After they took whatever I had, they stopped me " +
  "again and demanded more money; I told them I had no more money left to give them. Then they " +
  "suggested that I convert to Islam. I had to get out of the situation and told them that if I convert to " +
  "Islam, the other " + occupationAfghanistan.value + "s would not work with me. I told them when I make more money I " +
  "will give it to them. I bought some time. The Islamic Mujahidin mutilated the body an Afghan Hindu boy in our community " +
  "who refused to convert to Islam." + "\r\n\r\n" +

  "My family and I made the most difficult decision of our lives and moved to India in " + yearMoved.value + ". We went " +
  "through Pakistan and then India. It was heartbreaking and still hoped to return back to our country " +
  "Afghanistan. We hoped that the Mujahidin Government would be terminated. This did not happen and " +
  "instead the Mujahidin were toppled by another dreaded regime, the Taliban. Taliban were more brutal " +
  "than the Islamic Mujahidin. Again we did not lose hope and were waiting for an opportune time to " +
  "return back to our beloved Afghanistan. The Allied Forces toppled the Taliban in 2001 and the control of " +
  "the government fell to the remnants of the Islamic Mujahidin, the Northern Alliance. While in " + locationIndia.value + ", the " +
  "news was that the warlords in Afghanistan were usurping properties belonging to the Afghan Hindus " +
  "and Sikhs. Some Islamic Terrorists massacred the Hindus and Sikhs leadership in 2018 and again in 2020, " +
  "the terrorists killed close to 50 Sikhs in one of the Sikh temples of Kabul. We decided not to move back " +
  "to Afghanistan until things came under control. However the matter was getting worse by the day. It " +
  "was dashing the hope of our going back. In August of 2021, the Taliban came to Afghanistan by force " +
  "and totally dashed our hope of ever returning back to Afghanistan. The Hindus and Sikhs have been " +
  "summed up by Taliban and have been ordered not to dare out." + "\r\n\r\n" +

  "In India we have religious freedom and deal with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees " +
  "(UNHCR) frequently. UNHCR is inundated with too many refugees. However we find it very difficult to " +
  "fit in. When we speak Hindi, we have the Afghan accent which is recognizable, the weather is very hot " +
  "and we are used to the cold weather of Afghanistan. The food is very hot. It is very difficult to adjust. " +
  "After living in India for so long, we have realized that most of our successful community members had " +
  "migrated to North America and Europe. My family and I failed to develop the business contacts we had " +
  "in Afghanistan. We simply did not have the social net to help us live a normal life. I work for a business " +
  "in " + locationIndia.value + ", India and am one of the top producers; my income is $" + income.value + " per month. If I had my " +
  "community support, I could have started my own business and generated results. I find it very difficult to " +
  "navigate the Indian bureaucracy and trust the Chartered Accounts (CA)â€™s without proper references. I " +
  "need to live in North America or Europe where I would have my community support and have the vetted " +
  "business resources to succeed. In the bottom of my heart I consider myself a very good business person " +
  "and expert of the market which is universal all over the world. " + "\r\n\r\n" +
  
  "I would be very grateful for a chance to move to the west and prove my capabilities and generate results. " +
  "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n" +
  
  "Very sincerely yours,"+ "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n" +
