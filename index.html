  "Hello, my name is " + fullName.value + ", a legal citizan of Afghanistan. My family and I lived in " + locationAfghanistan.value + ", Afghanistan. " + 
  locationAfghanistan.value + " is a very nice area of Afghanistan. It is located xxx miles from Kabul, Afghanistan. We belong to the Afghan Hindu-Sikh Community in a majority Moslem country. " +
  "Our lives were normal before the Islamic Mujahidin came to power in Afghanistan in 1992. We had a family business and we were good in " + occupationAfghanistan.value + ". We were very successful in what we were doing and had become very " +
  "experienced in this field." + "\r\n\r\n" +
  "Everything changed after the Islamic Mujahidin came to power in 1992. They made life hell for the " +
  "Afghan Hindus and Sikhs and especially for the Hindus and Sikhs with businesses. They simply could not appreciate the know-how involved in " +
  "successfully running a business and were totally clueless. They started extorting money from us and we had to oblige " +
  "until we had little money left. Then the Mujahidin started convincing us to convert to Islam which we flatly ignored. They kept putting psychological pressure on us. " +
  "For a Hindu or a Sikh conversion to Islam is tantamount to a death sentence. The Hindus and Sikhs hold a funeral for a person who converts to Islam, so there is nothing worse for a Hindu or a Sikh than to convert to Islam. " +
  "We were extremely scared. The Mujahidin flag had the Kalima inscription in it and if any of a Hindus or a Sikhs read it, he/she would be considered a Moslem. " +
  "We became scared of the flag. We did not want to look at the flag or touch it. If a Hindu or a Sikh touched anything that had verses from Quran (the Moslem Book) written on it " +
  "he/she would be charged with the crime of Blasphemy which would carry the punishment stoned to death. We had to be extremely careful. No lawyer or judges would take the case. "+
  "" +
  "" +
  "The Islamic Mujahidin mutilated the body an Afghan Hindu boy in our community named Nikchu Khanna. " +
  "" + "\r\n\r\n" +

  "My family and I made the most difficult decision of our lives and moved to India in " + yearMoved.value + ". We went " +
  "through Pakistan and then India. It was heartbreaking and still hoped to return back to our country " +
  "Afghanistan. We hoped that the Mujahidin Government would be terminated. This did not happen and " +
  "instead the Mujahidin were toppled by another dreaded regime, the Taliban. Taliban were more brutal " +
  "than the Islamic Mujahidin. Again we did not lose hope and were waiting for an opportune time to " +
  "return back to our beloved Afghanistan. The Allied Forces toppled the dreaded Taliban in 2001 and the control of " +
  "the government fell to the remnants of the Islamic Mujahidin, the Northern Alliance. While in " + locationIndia.value + ", the " +
  "news was that the warlords in Afghanistan were usurping properties belonging to the Afghan Hindus " +
  "and Sikhs. Some Islamic Terrorists massacred the Hindus and Sikhs leadership in 2018 and again in 2020, " +
  "the terrorists killed close to 50 Sikhs in one of the Sikh temples of Kabul. We decided not to move back " +
  "to Afghanistan until things came under control. However the matter was getting worse by the day. It " +
  "was dashing the hope of our going back. In August of 2021, the Taliban came to Afghanistan by force " +
  "and totally dashed our hope of ever returning back to Afghanistan. The Hindus and Sikhs have been " +
  "summed up by Taliban and have been ordered not to dare out." + "\r\n\r\n" +
  "It is impossible to trust the Taliban, their words mean nothing. They follow Islam to the letter and there is simply no room for a Hindu or a Sikh to live "+
  "under their jurisdiction." +

  "In India we have total religious freedom and deal with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees " +
  "(UNHCR) frequently. UNHCR is inundated with too many refugees. However we find it very difficult to " +
  "fit in. When we speak Hindi, we have the Afghan accent which is recognizable, the weather is very hot " +
  "and we are used to the cold weather of Afghanistan. The food is very hot. It is very difficult to adjust. " +
  "After living in India for so long, we have realized that most of our successful community members had " +
  "migrated to North America and Europe. My family and I failed to develop the business contacts we had " +
  "in Afghanistan. We simply did not have the social net to help us live a normal life. The COVID-19 lock down in 2021 in New Delhi area " +
  " thought us a lesson that without a close community support, we can not survive. Our close community members in the USA and Europe came to our " +
  "rescue and helped us survive." + "\r\n\r\n" +
  "I work as a " + occupationIndia.value +
  " for a business in " + locationIndia.value + ", India and am one of the top producers; my income is $" + income.value + " per month. If I had my " +
  "community support, I could have started my own business and generated results. I find it very difficult to " +
  "navigate the Indian bureaucracy and trust the Chartered Accounts (CA)’s without proper references. The CA’s in India setup new business and do the compliance reporting I " +
  "need to live in North America or Europe where I would have my community support and have the vetted " +
  "business resources to succeed. In the bottom of my heart I consider ourselves very good business and expert in the Industry. " +
  "" + "\r\n\r\n" +
  
  "I would be very grateful for a chance to move to the west and prove my capabilities and generate results. " +
  "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n" +
